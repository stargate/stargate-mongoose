## Build & Test

Prerequisites:
- [Docker](https://docker.com/) / [JSON API](https://github.com/stargate/jsonapi)

### Build
```shell
npm install 
npm run build
```

### Test
- Start Docker
- Start JSON API
```shell
bin/start_json_api.sh
```
- Copy the `.env.example` file and create a new `.env` file that should have all of the connection details as shown below.

```env
JSON_API_URI=http://localhost:8080/v1/testks1
STARGATE_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8081/v1/auth
STARGATE_USERNAME=cassandra
STARGATE_PASSWORD=cassandra
```
- Run the tests
```shell
npm run test
```
## Update Stargate and JSON API versions

Stargate and the JSON API versions are maintained in the file `api-compatibility.versions`. Update the versions accordingly, submit a PR and make sure that the Github Actions that verify the new versions run fine.


## Build API Reference Documentation

API Documentation of this library is generated using [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown)

Run below to generate API documentation. This takes the `APIReference.hbs` and the library code as input and generates APIReference.md file.
```shell
npm run build:docs
```

## Publishing to npm registry

We are using [npm-publish](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/npm-publish) to handle publishing.
So to publish a release to NPM, we need to 
- Create a branch out of 'main' and change `version` in the `package.json` as needed.
- Run `npm install` (this will update `src/version.ts` file).
- Run `npm run build`
- Submit a PR and get that merged into `main` branch
- Check out 'main' branch & pull the latest
```shell
 git checkout main 
 git pull origin main
``` 
- Then create a tag with the required version, prefixed with 'rel-'. This will trigger a workflow that publishes the current version to npm. For example: `rel-0.2.0-ALPHA`
```
git tag rel-x.y.z
git push origin rel-x.y.z
```
- Finally, check the stargate-mongoose npm registry page https://www.npmjs.com/package/stargate-mongoose and make sure the latest version is updated.
